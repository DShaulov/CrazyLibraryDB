Using her past, present, and future to explore what matters most to women at different ages, Quindlen talks about<br /><b> </b><br /><b>Marriage: </b>“A safety net of small white lies can be the bedrock of a successful marriage. You wouldn’t believe how cheaply I can do a kitchen renovation.”<br />  <br /><b> Girlfriends:</b> “Ask any woman how she makes it through the day, and she may mention her calendar, her to-do lists, her babysitter. But if you push her on how she really makes it through her day, she will mention her girlfriends. Sometimes I will see a photo of an actress in an unflattering dress or a blouse too young for her or with a heavy-handed makeup job, and I mutter, ‘She must not have any girlfriends.’ ”<br />  <br /><b> Stuff:</b> “Here’s what it comes down to, really: there is now so much stuff in my head, so many years, so many memories, that it’s taken the place of primacy away from the things in the bedrooms, on the porch. My doctor says that, contrary to conventional wisdom, she doesn’t believe our memories flag because of a drop in estrogen but because of how crowded it is in the drawers of our minds. Between the stuff at work and the stuff at home, the appointments and the news and the gossip and the rest, the past and the present and the plans for the future, the filing cabinets in our heads are not only full, they’re overflowing.”<br />  <br /><b>Our bodies:</b> “I’ve finally recognized my body for what it is: a personality-delivery system, designed expressly to carry my character from place to place, now and in the years to come. It’s like a car, and while I like a red convertible or even a Bentley as well as the next person, what I really need are four tires and an engine.”<br />  <br /><b>Parenting:</b> “Being a parent is not transactional. We do not get what we give. It is the ultimate pay-it-forward endeavor: We are good parents not so they will be loving enough to stay with us but so they will be strong enough to leave us.”<br />  <br /> From childhood memories to manic motherhood to middle age, Quindlen uses the events of her own life to illuminate our own. Along with the downsides of age, she says, can come wisdom, a perspective on life that makes it satisfying and even joyful. Candid, funny, moving, <i>Lots</i> <i>of Candles, Plenty of Cake</i> is filled with the sharp insights and revealing observations that have long confirmed Quindlen’s status as America’s laureate of real life.',1,'2012-04-24 00:00:00.000000','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1330649974m/12752313.jpg','9d8bc21a.45e4.4655.971c.3e6ce8f461a2',5,9),('16045926-475e-4d39-83c3-f9925e6fecc8','Scarecrow (Shane Schofield, #3)','It is the greatest bounty hunt in history.

The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with—and perished from—for more than five thousand years. <br /><br />The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out “war against cancer.” <br /><br />The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave cut off her malignant breast, to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee’s own leukemia patient, Carla, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies </i>is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to survive—and to increase our understanding of this iconic disease. <br /><br />Riveting, urgent, and surprising, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies </i>provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments.

Ideas for new businesses, solutions to the world\'s problems, and artistic breakthroughs are common, but great execution is rare. <br /><br /> According to Scott Belsky, the capacity to make ideas happen can be developed by anyone willing to develop their organizational habits and leadership capability. That\'s why he founded Behance, a company that helps creative people and teams across industries develop these skills. <br /><br /> Belsky has spent six years studying the habits of creative people and teams that are especially productive-the ones who make their ideas happen time and time again. After interviewing hundreds of successful creatives, he has compiled their most powerful-and often counterintuitive-practices, such as:<br /><br /> •Generate ideas in moderation and kill ideas liberally <br /> •Prioritize through nagging <br /> •Encourage fighting within your team <br /><br /> While many of us obsess about discovering great new ideas, Belsky shows why it\'s better to develop the capacity to make ideas happen-a capacity that endures over time.',1,'2010-04-15 00:00:00.000000','https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png','0c6c89b1.677f.43f6.b71c.39796fdc687d',13,14),('1c2fba4c-9e26-4370-9783-2fbca6db269b','The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1: The Official Illustrated Movie Companion (The Twilight Saga: The Official Illustrated Movie Companion, #4)','A companion to the film, illustrated with full color photos.',1,'2011-12-13 00:00:00.000000','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327904795m/11260526.jpg','c2e42c75.7ca5.474f.8c27.13840fcb84f6',4,13),('1cd36247-02a6-46d6-ab22-2e4556079ef9','The Devil\'s Star (Harry Hole, #5)','A young woman is murdered in her Oslo flat.

What made him a genius? Isaacson’s biography shows how his scientific imagination sprang from the rebellious nature of his personality. His fascinating story is a testament to the connection between creativity and freedom.<br /><br /> Based on newly released personal letters of Einstein, this book explores how an imaginative, impertinent patent clerk—a struggling father in a difficult marriage who couldn’t get a teaching job or a doctorate—became the mind reader of the creator of the cosmos, the locksmith of the mysteries of the atom, and the universe. His success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for free minds, free spirits, and free individuals.<br /><br /> These traits are just as vital for this new century of globalization, in which our success will depend on our creativity, as they were for the beginning of the last century, when Einstein helped usher in the modern age.',1,'2000-01-01 00:00:00.000000','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328011405m/10884.jpg','4369c737.b3aa.451c.82a6.6e76ba2a4538',10,14),('23facf8c-5447-4661-aebd-4f78b63d1adc','Cities of the Plain (The Border Trilogy, #3)','The concluding volume of the Border trilogy.

But what makes <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.<br /><br />The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.',1,'2002-02-04 00:00:00.000000','https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png','6d8261a6.5ebf.4f6e.9484.a9c7869042ef',2,14),('253153fa-fa91-4b6c-8dfa-8ef78bb396bc','Among the Hidden (Shadow Children, #1)','SHADOW CHILDREN Luke has never been to school.

Now, in Flyboys, Bradley returns to World War II and an extraordinary-and totally unknown-true story of courage.</blockquote></b>Over the remote Pacific island of Chichi Jima, nine American flyers-Navy and Marine pilots sent to bomb Japanese communications towers there-were shot down. One of those nine was miraculously rescued by a U.S. Navy submarine. The others were captured by Japanese soldiers on Chichi Jima and held prisoner. Then they disappeared. When the war was over, the American government, along with the Japanese, covered up everything that had happened on Chichi Jima. The records of a top-secret military tribunal were sealed, the lives of the eight Flyboys were erased, and the parents, brothers, sisters, and sweethearts they left behind were left to wonder.<p>Flyboys reveals for the first time ever the extraordinary story of those men. Bradley\'s quest for the truth took him from dusty attics in American small towns, to untapped government archives containing classified documents, to the heart of Japan, and finally to Chichi Jima itself. What he discovered was a mystery that dated back far before World War II-back 150 years, to America\'s westward expansion and Japan\'s first confrontation with the western world.Bradley brings into vivid focus these brave young men who went to war for their country, and through their lives he also tells the larger story of two nations in a hellish war. With no easy moralizing, Bradley presents history in all its savage complexity, including the Japanese warrior mentality that fostered inhuman brutality and the U.S. military strategy that justified attacks on millions of civilians. And, after almost sixty years of mystery, Bradley finally reveals the fate of the eight American Flyboys, all of whom would ultimately face a moment and a decision that few of us can even imagine.Flyboys is a story of war and horror but also of friendship and honor. It is about how we die, and how we live-including the tale of the Flyboy who escaped capture, a young Navy pilot named George H. W.

She has finally found the Others she has been seeking. Though Ayla must learn their different customs and language, she is adopted because of her remarkable hunting ability, singular healing skills, and uncanny fire-making technique. Bringing back the single pup of a lone wolf she has killed, Ayla shows the way she tames animals. She finds women friends and painful memories of the Clan she left behind, and meets Ranec, the dark-skinned, magnetic master carver of ivory, whom she cannot refuse--inciting Jondalar to a fierce jealousy that he tries to control by avoiding her. Unfamiliar with the ways of the Others, Ayla misunderstands, and thinking Jondalar no longer loves her, she turns more to Ranec.

Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius Caesar. <br />On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family-and his adoptive brother-will be the most powerful force in his life. <br />As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat-under the tutelage of one of Rome\'s most fearsome gladiators-Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier\'s proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win. <br />The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict-a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test. <br />Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts-from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin. Superbly rendered, grippingly told, Emperor, The Gates of Rome is a work of vaulting imagination from a powerful new voice in historical fiction. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"',1,'2000-01-01 00:00:00.000000','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1313874666m/330947.jpg','5b7ba3f4.ed60.4600.9543.f9c0fe4f98c2',4,13),('2b54e08d-5b92-4c16-928f-139a768f8d89','The Exiled Queen (Seven Realms, #2)','Haunted by the loss of his mother and sister, Han Alister journeys south to begin his schooling at Mystwerk House in Oden’s Ford.

Three complete series have chronicled the ever-unfolding history of Shannara. But more stories are still to be told--and new adventures have yet to be undertaken. Book One of High Druid of Shannara invites both the faithful longtime reader and the curious newcomer to take the first step on the next extraordinary quest.<br /><br />Twenty years have passed since Grianne Ohmsford denounced her former life as the dreaded Ilse Witch--saved by the love of her brother, the magic of the Sword of Shannara, and the destruction of her evil mentor, the Morgawr. Now, fulfilling the destiny predicted for her, she has established the Third Druid Council, and dedicated herself to its goals of peace, harmony among the races, and defense of the Four Lands. But the political intrigue, secret treachery, and sinister deeds that have haunted Druid history for generations continue to thrive. And despite her devotion to the greater good as Ard Rhys--the High Druid of Paranor, Grianne still has bitter enemies. <br /><br />Among the highest ranks of the Council she leads lurk those who cannot forget her reign of terror as the Ilse Witch, who covet her seat of power, and who will stop at nothing to see her deposed . . . or destroyed. Even Grianne\'s few allies--chief among them her trusted servant Tagwen--know of the plots against her. But they could never anticipate the sudden, ominous disappearance of the Ard Rhys, in the dead of night and without a trace. Now, barely a step ahead of the dark forces bent on stopping him, Tagwen joins Grianne\'s brave young nephew, Pen Ohmsford, and the wise, powerful elf Ahren Elessedil on a desperate and dangerous mission of search and rescue--to deliver the High Druid of Shannara from an unspeakable fate. <br /><br />Expect no end of wonders, no shortage of adventure, exhilaration, suspense, and enchantment, as Terry Brooks demonstrates, once again, that there is no end to his magic of invention and mastery of storytelling. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"',1,'2005-07-26 00:00:00.000000','https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png','61948457.d7b2.4a84.b51f.b2429c9a3c05',4,10),('5538f544-981d-4245-8bbc-bb1eb02c1813','The Fire Within (The Last Dragon Chronicles, #1)','<b>A magical adventure about the power of dragons...</b><br /><br />When David moves in with Elizabeth Pennykettle and her eleven-year-old daughter, Lucy, he discovers a collection of clay dragons that come to life.

With the help of more than a dozen research and theoretical scientists, it takes you through the looking glass of quantum physics into a universe that is more bizarre and alive than ever imagined.

They developed different suites of flora &amp; fauna. When Columbus came to the Americas, he ended that separation. Driven by the goal of establishing trade with China, he accidentally set off an ecological convulsion as European vessels carried thousands of species to new environs.<br /><br />The Columbian Exchange, as researchers call it, is why there are tomatoes in Italy, oranges in Florida, chocolates in Switzerland &amp; chili peppers in Thailand. More important, creatures colonists knew nothing about hitched along. Earthworms, mosquitoes &amp; cockroaches; honeybees, dandelions &amp; African grasses; bacteria, fungi &amp; viruses; rats of every description—all rushed like eager tourists into lands that had never seen their like, changing lives &amp; landscapes.<br /><br />Eight decades later, a Spaniard named Legazpi succeeded where Columbus had failed. He sailed west to establish continual trade with China, then the richest, most powerful country. In Manila, a city Legazpi founded, American silver, mined by African &amp; Indian slaves, was sold to Asians in return for silk for Europeans. It was the 1st time that goods &amp; people from every part of the globe were connected in a single worldwide exchange. Much as Columbus created a new world biologically, Legazpi &amp; Spain created a new world economically.<br /><br />The Columbian Exchange underlies much of subsequent history. Presenting the latest research by ecologists, anthropologists, archaeologists &amp; historians, Mann shows how the creation of this worldwide network of ecological &amp; economic exchange fostered the rise of Europe, devastated China, convulsed Africa &amp; for two centuries made Mexico City--where Asia, Europe &amp; the new frontier of the Americas interacted--the center of the world.

He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante.<br />  <br /> His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York.<br />  <br /><i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i> is an intimate look at one of America\'s most beloved writers in the later years of his life—a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the South—which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand—<i>Travels with Charley</i> is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade. ',1,'2002-02-05 00:00:00.000000','https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png','6b46ff04.e7ee.41e3.a226.7fac9381b735',0,9),('6a3d7a9f-ac92-4102-b326-8138e877e096','Vampire Academy: The Ultimate Guide (Vampire Academy)','<b>Prepare to be Tested.</b><br /><b>The story that kicked off the international #1 bestselling <i>Vampire Academy</i> series is NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE.</b><br /><b>Read it Before it Hits Theaters February 14th, 2014!</b><br /><br /><b>The official guide to the #1 international bestselling Vampire Academy series</b><br /><br />Sink your teeth into the perfect holiday gift and must-have collector\'s item for every fan of Richelle Mead\'s totally addicting Vampire Academy series.<br /><br />Discover the history of St. Vladimir\'s Academy, explore the dark psychology behind Rose and Lissa\'s spirit bond, and find out even more illicit secrets about Moroi society.

In Jake, Glen Duncan has given us a werewolf for the twenty-first century—a man whose deeds can only be described as monstrous but who is in some magical way deeply human.<br /><br />Meet Jake. A bit on the elderly side (he turns 201 in March), but otherwise in the pink of health. The nonstop sex and exercise he\'s still getting probably contribute to that, as does his diet: unusual amounts of flesh and blood (at least some from friends and relatives). Jake, of course, is a werewolf, and with the death of his colleague he has now become the only one of his kind. This depresses Jake to the point that he\'s been contemplating suicide. Yet there are powerful forces who for very different reasons want - and have the power - to keep Jake alive. <br /><br />Here is a powerful new version of the werewolf legend - mesmerizing and undeniably sexy, and with moments of violence so elegantly wrought they dazzle rather than repel.

But there are some questions even the most advanced technologies cannot answer.<br /><br />Ridley Pearson has praised J. D.

It’s not the bodegas and pawnshops of East Harlem that bother her, though the neighborhood is a long way from the stone mansion she shares with her billionaire husband, Roarke. It’s all that holiness flying around at St. Christobal’s that makes her uneasy.<br /><br />A search of the victim’s sparsely furnished room reveals little-- except for a carefully hidden religious medal with a mysterious inscription, and a couple of underlined Bible passages. The autopsy reveals more: faint scars of knife wounds, a removed tattoo--and evidence of plastic surgery, suggesting that “Father Flores” may not have been the man his parishioners had thought.

Based on more than two hundred personal interviews with both current and former Scientologists--both famous and less well known--and years of archival research, Lawrence Wright uses his extraordinary investigative skills to uncover for us the inner workings of the Church of Scientology: its origins in the imagination of science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard; its struggles to find acceptance as a legitimate (and legally acknowledged) religion; its vast, secret campaign to infiltrate the U.S. government; and its dramatic efforts to grow and prevail after the death of Hubbard.<br /><br />At the book\'s center, two men whom Wright brings vividly to life, showing how they have made Scientology what it is today: The darkly brilliant L. Ron Hubbard--whose restless, expansive mind invented a new religion tailor-made to prosper in the spiritually troubled post-World War II era. And his successor, David Miscavige--tough and driven, with the unenviable task of preserving the church in the face of ongoing scandals and continual legal assaults.<br /><br />We learn about Scientology\'s esoteric cosmology; about the auditing process that determines an inductee\'s state of being; about the Bridge to Total Freedom, through which members gain eternal life. We see the ways in which the church pursues celebrities, such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and how young idealists who joined the Sea Org, the church\'s clergy, whose members often enter as children, signing up with a billion-year contract and working with little pay in poor conditions. We meet men and women \"disconnected\" from friends and family by the church\'s policy of shunning critical voices. And we discover, through many firsthand stories, the violence that has long permeated the inner sanctum of the church.<br /><br />In <i>Going Clear</i>, Wright examines what fundamentally makes a religion a religion, and whether Scientology is, in fact, deserving of the constitutional protections achieved in its victory over the IRS. Employing all his exceptional journalistic skills of observations, understanding, and synthesis, and his ability to shape a story into a compelling narrative, Lawrence Wright has given us an evenhanded yet keenly incisive book that goes far beyond an immediate exposé and uncovers the very essence of what makes Scientology the institution it is.',1,'2013-01-17 00:00:00.000000','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358119149m/16142053.jpg','25afeda4.b343.464a.9976.93634e2acfcf',2,7),('73b2dfbe-0dba-4a92-860d-9500d4fa9e76','The Mortal Instruments (The Mortal Instruments #1-4)','The Shadowhunters—touched by angels and charged with protecting innocents—battle demons and other evil in the bestselling Mortal Instruments series. <p><b><i>City of Bones </i></b></p><p>When Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder.

It’s also her first meeting with gorgeous, golden-haired Jace. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace’s world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon.

Clary would love to spend more time with her best friend, Simon. But the Shadowhunters won’t let her go—especially handsome, infuriating Jace. Clary’s only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil—and also Jace’s father.

Even worse, Jace does not want her there, and Simon has been thrown in prison by Shadowhunters who are deeply suspicious of a vampire who can withstand sunlight. Luckily, Clary finds an ally in the mysterious Sebastian, who holds a strange attraction for her. As Valentine musters a demon army, can Downworlders and Shadowhunters put aside their ancient hatred and work together? And can Clary harness her newfound powers to help save them all—whatever the cost? </p><p><b><i>City of Fallen Angels </i></b></p><p>The Mortal War is over, and Clary is back in New York, excited about all the possibilities before her.

But nothing comes without a price. Someone is murdering Shadowhunters, provoking tensions that could lead to a second, bloody war. Clary\'s best friend, Simon, can\'t help her. Everywhere he turns, someone wants him on their side—along with the power of the curse that\'s wrecking his life. Not to mention that he\'s dating two beautiful, dangerous girls—neither of whom knows about the other.

For those who already know these tales, the poignant introduction is a window on the creator\'s mind. Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes:<p> </p><blockquote> I look at these pieces and I don\'t think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we\'re healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present.<p> Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago. </p></blockquote><p> These enthusiastic tales are not ashamed of visceral horror, of blood splashing freely across the page: \"The Midnight Meat Train,\" a grisly subway tale that surprises you with one twist after another; \"The Yattering and Jack,\" about a hilarious demon who possesses a Christmas turkey; \"In the Hills, the Cities,\" an unusual example of an original horror premise; \"Dread,\" a harrowing non-supernatural tale about being forced to realize your worst nightmare; \"Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament,\" about a woman who kills men with her mind. Some of the tales are more successful than others, but all are distinguished by strikingly beautiful images of evil and destruction.

Then, to her amazement, the “coolest girl in the world” moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer’s end they’ve become <i>TullyandKate.</i> Inseparable.<br /><br />So begins Kristin Hannah’s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, <i>Firefly Lane</i> is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.<br /><br />From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness. <br /><br />Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn’t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she’ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she’ll envy her famous best friend. . . .<br /><br />For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they’ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.<br /><br /><i>Firefly Lane</i> is for anyone who ever drank Boone’s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it’s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It’s about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you---and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. <i>Firefly Lane </i>is a story you’ll never forget . . . one you’ll want to pass on to your best friend.',1,'2000-01-01 00:00:00.000000','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1362435448m/1472878.jpg','a3a5ab8b.6913.45a2.8863.29d2d9387efd',4,8),('8d9eef16-1202-4433-ba96-89a442b3bdd7','QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter','<br />Famous the world over for the creative brilliance of his insights into the physical world, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman also possessed an extraordinary talent for explaining difficult concepts to the nonscientist. QED--the edited version of four lectures on quantum electrodynamics that Feynman gave to the general public at UCLA as part of the Alix G. Mautner Memorial Lecture series--is perhaps the best example of his ability to communicate both the substance and the spirit of science to the layperson.<br />The focus, as the title suggests, is quantum electrodynamics (QED), the part of the quantum theory of fields that describes the interactions of the quanta of the electromagnetic field-light, X rays, gamma rays--with matter and those of charged particles with one another. By extending the formalism developed by Dirac in 1933, which related quantum and classical descriptions of the motion of particles, Feynman revolutionized the quantum mechanical understanding of the nature of particles and waves. And, by incorporating his own readily visualizable formulation of quantum mechanics, Feynman created a diagrammatic version of QED that made calculations much simpler and also provided visual insights into the mechanisms of quantum electrodynamic processes.<br /> In this book, using everyday language, spatial concepts, visualizations, and his renowned \"Feynman diagrams\" instead of advanced mathematics, Feynman successfully provides a definitive introduction to QED for a lay readership without any distortion of the basic science. Characterized by Feynman\'s famously original clarity and humor, this popular book on QED has not been equaled since its publication.<br />',1,'1988-10-21 00:00:00.000000','https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png','f75f2fdc.9366.42a6.8dd1.d579c2f81879',1,6),('8e82f97f-cd33-4edb-b94c-3221d27d6707','The Golden Lily (Bloodlines, #2)','Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.

Formorly in disgrace, Sydney is now praised for her loyalty and obedience, and held up as the model of an exemplary Alchemist.<br /><br /> But the closer she grows to Jill, Eddie, and especially Adrian, the more she finds herself questioning her age-old Alchemist beliefs, her idea of family, and her sense of what it means to truly belong. Her world becomes even more complicated when magical experiments show Sydney may hold the key to prevent becoming Strigoi - the fiercest vampires, the ones who don\'t die. But it\'s her fear of being just that - special, magical, powerful - that scares her more than anything. Equally daunting is her new romance with Braydon, a cute, brainy guy who seems to be her match in every way.

Baumeister collaborates with renowned <i>New York Times</i> science writer John Tierney to revolutionize our understanding of the most coveted human virtue: self-control.<br /><br />In what became one of the most cited papers in social science literature, Baumeister discovered that willpower actually operates like a muscle: it can be strengthened with practice and fatigued by overuse. Willpower is fueled by glucose, and it can be bolstered simply by replenishing the brain\'s store of fuel. That\'s why eating and sleeping- and especially failing to do either of those-have such dramatic effects on self-control (and why dieters have such a hard time resisting temptation).<br /><br />Baumeister\'s latest research shows that we typically spend four hours every day resisting temptation. No wonder people around the world rank a lack of self-control as their biggest weakness. <i>Willpower</i> looks to the lives of entrepreneurs, parents, entertainers, and artists-including David Blaine, Eric Clapton, and others-who have flourished by improving their self-control.<br /><br />The lessons from their stories and psychologists\' experiments can help anyone. You learn not only how to build willpower but also how to conserve it for crucial moments by setting the right goals and using the best new techniques for monitoring your progress. Once you master these techniques and establish the right habits, willpower gets easier: you\'ll need less conscious mental energy to avoid temptation. That\'s neither magic nor empty self-help sloganeering, but rather a solid path to a better life.<br /><br />Combining the best of modern social science with practical wisdom, Baumeister and Tierney here share the definitive compendium of modern lessons in willpower. As our society has moved away from the virtues of thrift and self-denial, it often feels helpless because we face more temptations than ever. But we also have more knowledge and better tools for taking control of our lives. However we define happiness-a close- knit family, a satisfying career, financial security-we won\'t reach it without mastering self-control.',1,'2011-09-01 00:00:00.000000','https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png','97e28433.dedc.4986.9ec0.e5b221995197',1,12),('9acfeee0-2a5b-46ed-85b5-dfdcd3527b41','The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream','<b>The Audacity of Hope</b> is Barack Obama\'s call for a new kind of politics—a politics that builds upon those shared understandings that pull us together as Americans.

After a childhood moving from one academic outpost to another with her father (a man prone to aphorisms and meteoric affairs), Blue is clever, deadpan, and possessed of a vast lexicon of literary, political, philosophical, and scientific knowledge—and is quite the cineaste to boot. In her final year of high school at the elite (and unusual) St. Gallway School in Stockton, North Carolina, Blue falls in with a charismatic group of friends and their captivating teacher, Hannah Schneider.

From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none.<br /><br />Losing My Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that \"since we\'re complete virgins at business, let\'s call it just that: Virgin.\" Since then, Branson has written his own \"rules\" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy.<br /><br />Many of Richard Branson\'s companies--airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, \"Don\'t do it.\" But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. <br />And in this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson\'s life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories:<br /><br /> Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globe<br /><br />Signing the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins<br /><br />Fighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishment<br /><br />Swimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico<br /><br />Selling Virgin Records to save Virgin Atlantic<br /><br />Staging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . .<br /><br />And much more.

In <i>The Poisoner\'s Handbook</i> Blum draws from highly original research to track the fascinating, perilous days when a pair of forensic scientists began their trailblazing chemical detective work, fighting to end an era when untraceable poisons offered an easy path to the perfect crime. <br /><br /> Drama unfolds case by case as the heroes of <i>The Poisoner\'s Handbook</i>—chief medical examiner Charles Norris and toxicologist Alexander Gettler—investigate a family mysteriously stricken bald, Barnum and Bailey\'s Famous Blue Man, factory workers with crumbling bones, a diner serving poisoned pies, and many others. Each case presents a deadly new puzzle and Norris and Gettler work with a creativity that rivals that of the most imaginative murderer, creating revolutionary experiments to tease out even the wiliest compounds from human tissue. Yet in the tricky game of toxins, even science can\'t always be trusted, as proven when one of Gettler\'s experiments erroneously sets free a suburban housewife later nicknamed \"America\'s Lucretia Borgia\" to continue her nefarious work. <br /><br /> From the vantage of Norris and Gettler\'s laboratory in the infamous Bellevue Hospital it becomes clear that killers aren\'t the only toxic threat to New Yorkers. Modern life has created a kind of poison playground, and danger lurks around every corner. Automobiles choke the city streets with carbon monoxide; potent compounds, such as morphine, can be found on store shelves in products ranging from pesticides to cosmetics. Prohibition incites a chemist\'s war between bootleggers and government chemists while in Gotham\'s crowded speakeasies each round of cocktails becomes a game of Russian roulette. Norris and Gettler triumph over seemingly unbeatable odds to become the pioneers of forensic chemistry and the gatekeepers of justice during a remarkably deadly time.

Kovacs can deal with the madness of AI. He can do his part in a battle against biomachines gone wild, search for a three-centuries-old missing weapons system, and live with a blood feud with the yakuza, and even with the betrayal of people he once trusted.

She refuses to set her beloved husband free to marry the queen; but she cannot prevent him from becoming the favorite and the focus of the feverishly plotting, pleasure seeking court.<br /><br />Others too oppose the marriage, but for very different reasons. William Cecil, the queen\'s wisest counselor, knows she must marry for policy; her uncle hates Dudley and swears he will be murder him first. Behind the triangle of lovers, the factions take up their places: the Protestants, the priests, the assassins, the diplomats and the moneymakers. The very coin of England is shaved and clipped to nothing as Elizabeth uncertainly leads her bankrupt country into a war that no-one thinks can be won.<br /><br />Then someone acts in secret, and for Elizabeth, Dudley and the emerging kingdom, nothing will be as planned.<br /><br />Blending historical fact with contemporary rumor, Philippa Gregory has created a dark and tense novel of Tudor times, which casts Elizabeth I in a light no one has suggested before.

Han is hurt and betrayed. He knows he has no future with a blueblood. And, as far as he’s concerned, the princess’s family as good as killed his own mother and sister.

Conventionally regarded as a history play, much of it is in fact conspicuously invented fiction, and Kastan argues that the non-historical, comic plot does not simply parody the historical action but by its existence raises questions about the very nature of history. The full and engaging introduction devotes extensive discussion to the play\'s language, indicating how its insistent economic vocabulary provides texture for the social concerns of the play and focuses attention on the central relationship between value and political authority. Kastan also covers the recurrence of the word \"honor\" in the text and the role that women play.  Appendices provide the sources of <i>1 Henry IV</i>, discussions of Shakespeare\'s metrics, and the history of the manuscript.  The appendix on casting features a doubling chart to show which characters may be played by one actor.  Photographic images of the original Q0 Fragment, which is assumed to have been printed in Peter Short\'s printing house in 1598, appear in the fifth appendix. Finally, a reference section provides a list of abbreviations and references, a catalog of Shakespeare’s works and works partly by Shakespeare, and citations for the modern productions mentioned in the text, other collated editions of Shakespeare\'s work, and other related reading.</div><div><b></b> </div><div><b>The Arden Shakespeare</b> has developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume. An introduction comprehensively contextualizes the play, chronicling the history and culture that surrounded and influenced Shakespeare at the time of its writing and performance, and closely surveying critical approaches to the work. Detailed appendices address problems like dating and casting, and analyze the differing Quarto and Folio sources. A full commentary by one or more of the play’s foremost contemporary scholars illuminates the text, glossing unfamiliar terms and drawing from an abundance of research and expertise to explain allusions and significant background information.

Part memoir, part historical and social analysis, J. D. Vance’s <i>Hillbilly Elegy</i> is a fascinating consideration of class, culture, and the American dream.<br /><br />Vance’s grandparents were “dirt poor and in love.” They got married and moved north from Kentucky to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. Their grandchild (the author) graduated from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of their success in achieving upward mobility for their family. But Vance cautions that is only the short version. The slightly longer version is that his grandparents, aunt, uncle, and mother struggled to varying degrees with the demands of their new middle class life and they, and Vance himself, still carry around the demons of their chaotic family history. <br /><br />Delving into his own personal story and drawing on a wide array of sociological studies, Vance takes us deep into working class life in the Appalachian region. This demographic of our country has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, and Vance provides a searching and clear-eyed attempt to understand when and how “hillbillies” lost faith in any hope of upward mobility, and in opportunities to come.<br /><br />At times funny, disturbing, and deeply moving, this is a family history that is also a troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large portion of this country.',1,'2016-06-28 00:00:00.000000','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463569814m/27161156.jpg','a314816f.c21b.4c64.a4af.d16a8345850b',6,9),('d5b7780d-676f-4a59-8319-56805142e6c1','Nourishing Traditions: The Cookbook That Challenges Politically Correct Nutrition and the Diet Dictocrats','In this popular and comprehensive book, nutrition researcher and founder of the Weston A.

A boundary is a personal property line that marks those things for which we are responsible. In other words, boundaries define who we are and who we are not. Boundaries impact all areas of our lives: Physical boundaries help us determine who may touch us and under what circumstances -- Mental boundaries give us the freedom to have our own thoughts and opinions -- Emotional boundaries help us to deal with our own emotions and disengage from the harmful, manipulative emotions of others -- Spiritual boundaries help us to distinguish God\'s will from our own and give us renewed awe for our Creator -- Often, Christians focus so much on being loving and unselfish that they forget their own limits and limitations. When confronted with their lack of boundaries, they ask: - Can I set limits and still be a loving person? - What are legitimate boundaries? - What if someone is upset or hurt by my boundaries? - How do I answer someone who wants my time, love, energy, or money? - Aren\'t boundaries selfish? - Why do I feel guilty or afraid when I consider setting boundaries? Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend offer biblically-based answers to these and other tough questions, showing us how to set healthy boundaries with our parents, spouses, children, friends, co-workers, and even ourselves.',1,'2000-01-01 00:00:00.000000','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1406403521m/525488.jpg','93d23353.c137.43ee.bbdd.b8b8a89cd117',0,8),('f17251ad-6fec-4acd-93b1-9b37f207ee8a','Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay','<p>When Magizoologist Newt Scamander arrives in New York, he intends his stay to be just a brief stopover.

As a result, over 100 million of them experience some form of adverse health effect, ranging from minor rashes and high blood sugar to the unattractive stomach bulges that preventive cardiologist William Davis calls \"wheat bellies.\" According to Davis, that excess fat has nothing to do with gluttony, sloth, or too much butter: It\'s due to the whole grain wraps we eat for lunch.<br /><br />After witnessing over 2,000 patients regain their health after giving up wheat, Davis reached the disturbing conclusion that wheat is the single largest contributor to the nationwide obesity epidemic—and its elimination is key to dramatic weight loss and optimal health.

That man was Darth Bane, a twisted genius whose iron will, fierce ambition, and strength in the dark side of the Force made him a natural leader among the Sith until his radical embrace of an all-but-forgotten wisdom drove him to destroy his own order . . . and create it anew from the ashes. As the last surviving Sith, Darth Bane promulgated a harsh new directive: the Rule of Two.<br /><br />Two there should be; no more, no less.<br />One to embody the power, the other to crave it.<br /><br />Now Darth Bane is ready to put his policy into action, and he thinks he has found the key element that will make his triumph complete: a student to train in the ways of the dark side. Though she is young, Zannah possesses an instinctive link to the dark side that rivals his own. With his guidance, she will become essential in his quest to destroy the Jedi and dominate the galaxy.<br /><br />But there is one who is determined to stop Darth Bane: Johun Othone, Padawan to Jedi Master Lord Hoth, who died at Banes hands in the last great Sith War.

But as peace once again settled upon the land, a lost generation of sea serpents--ancient, half-starved, and weary—returned to cocoon, certain that they would be reborn as the beautiful and powerful dragons of legend. But their arduous journey exacted a heavy toll, and the proud serpents emerged as sickly, half-formed beasts, unable to fly or hunt . . . or thrive.<br /><br />For years now they have been trapped on a swampy riverbank between forest and river, hungry and barely alive, reliant on humans to provide for them.With their survival at stake, fifteen dragons—among them the wise golden Mercor, the haughty and dazzling silver-blue queen Sintara, and the delicate copper beauty Relpda—have set off on a dangerous trek into the unknown, up the Rain Wild River, in hopes of rediscovering the ancient Elderling city of Kelsingra, the lost haven for dragons and Elderlings alike.<br /><br />The dragons are accompanied by a disparate group of human keepers, rejects from Rain Wild society. They, too, yearn to find Kelsingra and create a home of their own, one in which they may make their own rules and decide their own fate.

But she was beginning to feel a sense of longing for a family and for home. When she interviewed a dynamic young farmer, her world changed. Kristin knew nothing about growing vegetables, let alone raising pigs and cattle and driving horses. But on an impulse, smitten, if not yet in love, she shed her city self and moved to five hundred acres near Lake Champlain to start a new farm with him. The Dirty Life is the captivating chronicle of their first year on Essex Farm, from the cold North Country winter through the following harvest season—complete with their wedding in the loft of the barn. <br /><br />Kimball and her husband had a plan: to grow everything needed to feed a community. It was an ambitious idea, a bit romantic, and it worked.

The work is done by draft horses instead of tractors, and the fertility comes from compost. Kimball’s vivid descriptions of landscape, food, cooking—and marriage—are irresistible. <br /><br /><i>\"As much as you transform the land by farming,\"</i> she writes, <i>\"farming transforms you.\"</i> In her old life, Kimball would stay out until four a.m., wear heels, and carry a handbag.
